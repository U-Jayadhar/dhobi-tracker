## Tech Stack

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/):** React framework for building performant web applications.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/):** Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **[GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/):**  A service for sharing code snippets, notes, and other small pieces of text or code.

## Data Storage

This application uses a **JSON file-based storage system** to persist data. This approach was chosen for its simplicity and to avoid the complexity of setting up a database, making it ideal for a single-user application.

- **File Location:** The data is stored in a file named `records.json`, located in the GitHub `Gist`.
- **API Routes:** Next.js API routes are used to read and write data to the `records.json` file. The following API endpoints are available:
  - `GET /api/records`: Retrieves all records from the `records.json` file.
  - `POST /api/records`: Adds a new record to the `records.json` file.
- **Note about Committing to Git:** This file is meant to be tracked in GitHub

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    cd [your-repository-name]
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    npm install  # or yarn install or pnpm install
